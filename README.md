# HyperLedger-Fabric-Hands-On-Workshop
Learn to Build Blockchain Applications with Hyperledger Fabric


```
The Hyperledger Project is quickly becoming the front-runner in enterprise Blockchain solutions and has attracted talent and resources from industry leaders like IBM and Intel in an open source collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing, and Technology.

In this workshop, you will learn:
How to deploy applications with Hyperledger Fabric and the IBM Blockchain Platform, which is designed to accelerate the development, governance, and operation of enterprise business networks running on the IBM Cloud.



```
### What you will learn
1. Understand and setup the basics of Hyperledger Fabric network
1. How to code and run the FabCar tutorial
1. How to create and setup a smart contract example blockchain application using the IBM Cloud.

## Prerequisites
- [Node v8.x or greater and npm v5.x or greater](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Yeoman (yo) v2.x](http://yeoman.io/)
- [Docker version v17.06.2-ce or greater](https://www.docker.com/get-docker)
- [Docker Compose v1.14.0 or greater](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [VSCode version 1.26 or greater](https://code.visualstudio.com)

```
Why Visual Studio Code.  It's easier to 
get things started.  There are perfectly adequate
shell scripts on the HyperFabric samples direcgtory that let you do this in case you are
a command line only programmer.
