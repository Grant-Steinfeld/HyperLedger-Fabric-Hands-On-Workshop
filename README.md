Here is the [PowerPoint deck](./Hyperledger-Fabric-March.2019.v2.1.pptx) for this workshop.

## Learn to Build Blockchain Applications with Hyperledger Fabric

```
The Hyperledger Project is quickly becoming the front-runner in enterprise blockchain solutions 
and has attracted talent and resources from industry leaders like IBM and Intel in an open
source collaborative effort to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies.
It is a global collaboration, hosted by The Linux Foundation, 
including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chain, service/parts maintainence, manufacturing, and technology.
```
### What you will learn
1. What the core techinical components are that make up a basic instance of a Hyperledger Fabric Blockchain consortium.
1. Understand a how to setup, code and run a local Commercial Paper Smart Contract example by using the IBM Blockchain Visual Studio Code extension.


## Prerequisites
Please setup the following [prerequisites](./PREREQUISITES.md) before the workshop, so we can spend time on coding rather than setup.
If you have any trouble setting them up, don't worry we can help you either before or after the workshop.


# Steps
## Development on your local environment
### We will walk you through and help you to code this excellent tutorial on IBM Developer 
[Run a commercial paper smart contract with the IBM Blockchain VS Code extension](https://developer.ibm.com/tutorials/run-commercial-paper-smart-contract-with-ibm-blockchain-vscode-extension/)
